config.mak: config.mak.in
	./configure

config.h: config.h.in
	./configure

# PS: the config.h file is specific to the target that was configured.
# At the moment, we use a single config.h file in ./, so if you want
# to change target, you have to reconfigure the SSL bundle, which
# would remove the configuration for the previous target and create a
# configuration for the new target.
#
# A possible improvement would be to have configure store each
# config.h file in a target-specific directory so that when you
# reconfigure for a different target, you don't lose the configuration
# for the previous target.  It doesn't seem to help much though as you
# still have to configure and build multiple times.

**************

The GNUstep Base Library, version 1.24.0, is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep Base Library?
=====================================

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.

   It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

   There is more information available at the GNUstep homepage at
`http://www.gnustep.org'.

1.2 Noteworthy changes in version `1.24.0'
==========================================

   * There is binary incompatibility on 64bit systems in that the value
     of the NSNotFound constant there is now 64bits rather than 32bits.

   * gcc-4.0 is the minimum official supported compiler for GNUstep

   * Support for the GNU LANGUAGES environment variable and other locale
     improvements

   * IPV6 support for NSHost and networking operations

   * Support for UTF-8 string literals in source (compiler permitting)

1.3 Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==================================================

The gnustep-base-1.24.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed at
`ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/core'.

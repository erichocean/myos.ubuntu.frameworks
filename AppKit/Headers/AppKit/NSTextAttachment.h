/**
NSTextAttachment is used to represent text attachments. When inline, 
text attachments appear as the value of the NSAttachmentAttributeName 
attached to the special character NSAttachmentCharacter.
   
NSTextAttachment uses an object obeying the NSTextAttachmentCell 
protocol to get input from the user and to display an image.

NSTextAttachmentCell is a simple subclass of NSCell which provides 
the NSTextAttachment protocol.

/** The new way of placing the cell. **/

/* Returns the rectangle in which the cell should be drawn. The rectangle
is relative to the current point when typesetting. Positive y is up.

lineFrag is the line frag rect that this cell might be placed in, and
position is the current position in that line frag rect (positive y is
up). Note that the line frag rect and glyph position may not be where
the cell is actually placed.

Note that this might be called many times for the same attachment. Eg. if
you return a rectangle that won't fit in the proposed line frag rect, the
typesetter might try to adjust things so it will fit. It will then send
this message with a new proposed line frag rect and glyph position. Thus,
great care must be taken when using the line frag rect to calculate the
returned rectangle to prevent the typesetting process from getting stuck.

The class uses -cellSize and -cellBaselineOffset to return a rect.

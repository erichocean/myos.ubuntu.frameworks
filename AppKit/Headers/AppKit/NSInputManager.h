/* The input manager understands quite sophisticated keybindings.  
 *
 * A certain keystroke (represented by a unichar + some modifiers) can
 * be bound to a selector.  For example: "Control-f" = "moveForward:";
 * If you press Control-f, the selector moveForward: is invoked.
 *
 * A certain keystroke can be bound to an array of selectors.  For
 * example: "Control-k" = ("moveToBeginningOfLine:", "deleteToEndOfLine:");
 * If you press Control-k, the selector moveToBeginningOfLine: is invoked,
 * immediately followed by deleteToEndOfLine:.
 *
 * A certain keystroke can be bound to a dictionary of other
 * keybindings.  For example "Control-c" = { "Control-f" =
 * "openFile:"; "Control-s" = "save:"; };
 * If you press Control-c followed by Control-f, openFile: is invoked;
 * if you press Control-c followed by Control-s, save: is invoked.
 *
 * Any keystroke which is not bound by a keybinding is basically inserted
 * as it is by calling 'insertText:' of the caller.
 *
 * Control-g is normally bound to aborting the current keybinding
 * sequence.  Whenever you are confused about what the hell you have
 * typed and what strange command the input manager is going to
 * understand, just type Control-g to discard past pending keystrokes,
 * and reset the input manager.
 *
 * Control-q is normally bound to literally quoting the next
 * keystroke.  That is, the next keystroke is *not* interpreted by the
 * input manager, but rather inserted literally into the text.

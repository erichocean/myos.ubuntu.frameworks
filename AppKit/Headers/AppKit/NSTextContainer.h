/**
A text container defines a region in the plane. It is used by the
text system to lay out text: text is laid out inside this region. A layout
manager has a list of text containers that it lays out text in. A text
container may have one NSTextView attached to it that displays the text laid
out in the text container.

Note that the coordinate system used by NSTextContainer is the
same as in the rest of the text system classes, ie. positive y is down.

NSTextContainer itself defines a simple rectangular region as large as the
container size. In most cases, only a single, simple text container is used
with a layout manager and a text view. Examples of cases where you might want
to use several text containers, or subclasses that define more complex
regions, are:

<list>
  <item>
    Multi-page layout; one text container for each page.
  </item><item>
    Multi-column layout; one text container for each column.
  </item><item>
    Layout flowing around pictures; the text container would define a region
    that does not include the space used by the picture.
  </item>
</list>

If the region defined by a text container can change dynamically, the text
container should call [GSLayoutManager-textContainerChangedGeometry:]
whenever this happens.

/**
This is the main method used by the text system for querying the region
and flowing text in it. It takes a proposed line fragment rectangle and,
if possible, splits it into a valid line fragment rectangle, and a remaining
rectangle that can be used in subsequent calls to this method.

sweepDir is the direction that text moves inside the lines, and moveDir is
the direction lines move in, or NSLineDoesntMove if the line may not move.
The line sweep and line movement may not both be in the same dimension, ie.
both be vertical, or both be horizontal.

The method returns the first (according to the sweep direction) valid line
fragment rectangle in the proposed rectangle. This line fragment rectangle
is a sub-rectangle of the proposed rectangle in the sweep direction, and has
the same size in the other direction. (Ie. if the sweep direction is left,
the line fragment rectangle must have the same height as the proposed
rectangle.) If there is no valid line fragment rectangle in the proposed
rectangle, the proposed rectangle may be moved in the line movement direction
until there is one. If no valid line fragment rectangle can be returned,
the method returns NSZeroRect.

The remaining rectangle should be set to the potentially valid part of the
proposed rectangle, after moving in the line movement direction, that remains
after the first line fragment rectangle.

The proposed rectangle may be any rectangle; in particular, it may extend
outside the container size. The remaining rectangle does not have to be or
contain a valid line fragment rectangle.

Subclasses define regions by overriding this method.

Note: The TextContainerExample in the text system example collection
(TODO: link) contains an example implementation of an NSTextContainer subclass
that defiens a non-trivial region, as well as an interactive demonstration of
this method. It can also be used as a simple test of custom subclasses.

Note: Although a correct NSTextContainer implementation must handle all line
sweep and movement directions, the current standard typesetter will only call
this method with sweep right, and no movement or movement down. Relying on
this makes writing a subclass easier, but it is <em>not</em> safe.

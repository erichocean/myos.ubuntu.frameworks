TODO:
Since temporary attributes are set for _character_ ranges and not _glyph_
ranges, a bunch of things could be simplified here (in particular, a
character can't be in several runs anymore, so there's no need to worry
about that or search over run boundaries).

(2002-11-27): All comments should be clarified now.
